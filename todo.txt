Consider whether add other weekdays again
Save whole network
Split users by morning and evening

Data preparation
- Check that interaction cutoff 1 is whole network
- Directed, times of interaction between users colors arc
- List of threads and lenght of time on homepage
- Line plot of 16 overlayed single-peak and 16 multi-peak
- See MM

Clusters
- Reciprocity inside and outside of windows
- Directed small plot with bended arrows, see if diff
- See MM

## Info

Clusering coeff nr of triplets closed / total nr of triplets, can do
hash a => b, b => c, c => a. Does vary with network size, no solut.

Wondering about regression over matrix (distances)
Can turn into lists with same cases but corrections for
non-independence

## Cut

Bonus
- Geo-code users, create graph of overlayed
  - Posts with timezone times overlayed
- Video of network as changes
  - Add time-stamps
- Prettify color coding and legenda
  - fix opacity
  - bars in stata
- Regression
  - weekend vs weekday difference in time effect
  - time-zone shift US vs UK distance
  - weed out non-principle component for regressions
- Proportion that interacts within window / window distance
- Degree and betweenness centrality scatter plot
- Get more timezone data

Blog post
- Best time to post, karma?
  - karma with time & with depth

Not at all
- Fix gaps
- Weight posts relative to nr of posts in window
- Unprolific and prolific posts per hour
- Regression
  - karma difference
  - join time distance
- Thread distance
  - avg/median thread distance of users posts (transitive min is netw)
- Threads only briefly on homepage
  - Low rated
  - Small
- Cluster-coeffs for whole vs parts
  - also corrected for varying network-sizes
