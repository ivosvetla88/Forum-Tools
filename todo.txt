Data preparation
- Fix errors
- Directed, times of interaction between users colors arc
- Redo clusters
- Weed out non-principle component view map if better
- Nr of closed triads
- List of threads and lenght of time on homepage
- Weight posts relative to nr of posts in window
- Collapse to circle network, added up links
- Distance (width) in the thread vs abs time distance

Clusters
- Cluster-spotting, see if time-related, in NodeXL
- Find way of pruning networks to k-components or random

Regression on social distance versus
- time distance

## Info

Clusering coeff nr of triplets closed / total nr of triplets, can do
hash a => b, b => c, c => a. Does vary with network size, no solut.

Wondering about regression over matrix (distances)
Can turn into lists with same cases but corrections for
non-independence

## Cut

Bonus
- Best time to post, karma?
  - karma with time & with depth
- Video of network as changes
  - Add time-stamps
- Prettify color coding and legenda
- Geo & time-locate users + spatial distance
  - spatial distance

Not at all
- karma difference
- join time distance
- time distance between posts in thread without thread
- Time-series
  - Posts with timezone times overlayed
- thread distance
- avg/median thread distance of users posts (transitive min is netw)
- Threads only briefly on homepage
  - Low rated
  - Small
- Cluster-coeffs for whole vs parts
  - also corrected for varying network-sizes
- Proportion that interacts within window / window distance
