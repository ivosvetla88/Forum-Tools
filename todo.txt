Data preparation
- Calculate measures for whole network
- Aggregate hourly posts for both timezones separately
- List of threads and lenght of time on homepage
- Time sort threads for karma heatmap
- Time between posts for users in core network
- See MM

Clusters
- Reciprocity inside and outside of windows
- Directed small plot with bended arrows, see if diff
- See MM

Essay
- Add bit on threads varying times on homepage

## Info

Clusering coeff nr of triplets closed / total nr of triplets, can do
hash a => b, b => c, c => a. Does vary with network size, no solut.

  - karma difference
  - join time distance
- Thread distance
  - avg/median thread distance of users posts (transitive min is netw)
- Threads only briefly on homepage
  - Low rated
  - Small
- Cluster-coeffs for whole vs parts
  - also corrected for varying network-sizes
