Data preparation
- Support graphml
- Consider random selection from network
- Reciprocity, hunt for time effects
- Test circadian difference
- Fix weights in Giph
- Distance measures
  - time distance between posts in thread without thread
  - social distance of users (in reply & user-to-thread networks)
- Proportion that interacts within window / window distance
- Prettify color coding and legenda
- Store networks in var

Clusters
- Cluster-spotting, see if time-related
- Cluster-coeffs for whole vs parts
  - also corrected for varying network-sizes
- Degrees of reciprocity
- Find way of pruning networks to k-components or random

Regression on social distance versus
- time distance

## Info

Clusering coeff nr of triplets closed / total nr of triplets, can do
hash a => b, b => c, c => a. Does vary with network size, no solut.

## Other

E-mail bernie

Wondering about regression over matrix (distances)
Can turn into lists with same cases but corrections for
non-independence

## Cut

Bonus
- Best time to post, karma?
  - karma with time & with depth
- Video of network as changes

Not at all
- karma difference
- join time distance
- Geo & time-locate users + spatial distance
  - spatial distance
- Time-series
  - Posts with timezone times overlayed
- thread distance
- avg/median thread distance of users posts (transitive min is netw)
- Threads only briefly on homepage
  - Low rated
  - Small
